# bitcoin_checkout

This project is part of a test to evaluate my Java programming skills.

## The objective
A developer must be able to buy and sell bitcoins through the program.
- if he's selling, the price of the bitcoin must be added to his balance
- if he's buying it must be decreased (in case he doesn't have enough money in his account the operation should not be computed).
The interface with the user must be made in the command prompt.

## About the program
The user starts with R$10,00 to be able to start transactions.
#### The commands work as follows:
- create bitcoin [id] [value] (in order to add a new coin to the possible selling and buying list)
- buy bitcoin [id] [quant]
- sell bitcoin [id] [quant]
- quit
